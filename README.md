Advanced AI-Powered Task Dashboard
üìñ Description
This is a commercial-grade, single-page Task Management Dashboard built entirely with frontend technologies. It offers a seamless, real-time, and intelligent user experience for managing tasks without requiring a backend. The application can run in two modes: Local Storage Mode (offline, no setup required) or Firebase Mode (live, collaborative, and persistent data).

This project demonstrates advanced frontend skills, including DOM manipulation, modern JavaScript (ES6+), data management (Firebase/LocalStorage), and integration with external services.

üöÄ Getting Started
You can run this project in two ways:

1. Local Mode (Quick & Easy)
No setup is needed! Just download the index.html file and open it in your favorite web browser. The application will automatically detect that Firebase is not configured and will use your browser's local storage to save all your data.

2. Firebase Mode (For Live & Collaborative Features)
To run the application with a live database, follow these steps:

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add a Web App to your project.

Copy the firebaseConfig object provided.

Set up Firestore:

In your Firebase project, go to Firestore Database and create a new database.

Start in production mode.

Go to the Rules tab and paste the following rules to allow the app to read and write data:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

Publish the rules.

Add Config to index.html:

Open the index.html file.

Find the <script> tag near the bottom of the file.

Replace the placeholder values in the firebaseConfig object with the keys you copied from your Firebase project.

// Before
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // ...
};

// After
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  // ...
};

Now, when you open the index.html file, it will connect to your Firebase project and store data online.
